Local VirtualBox, AWS, GCP Ansible cluster

This small project is to simply automate all aspects of an Ansible based cluster that will ultimately serve any general full stack service.

It's my pet project and it's a playground to allow me to grow any minimal DevOps skillset by simply making all components of a cluster managed with Ansible.

I am simply having fun with it and most of the scripts have been basic code I came accros the Internets learned and adapted it for my AnsCluster purpposes.

Ultimately I hope to abridge all code and scripts to meet better and efficient Bash. Also end goal is to create Python scripts that mirror all Bash functionality as Python is my new endeavor.

So not much to see yet but I at least want to share this simply scripts that are fully functional for what I am presently working on and the initial phase/scope of my Project. As I continue to strengthen Cloud technologies, I have already practiced spun up several VMs Instances in AWS and GCP. All Ans VMs in the cluster will talk to local VirtualBox, AWS, and GCP compute VMs.

Many next steps but some are to fill in all Github features and document progress in Projects and Wiki.

Thank you for reading this far :)!
